location: State College, PA, USA

abstract: "Gravitational waves (GWs) have been detected for the first time in
2015 and so far all detections were made using templates for well-modelled
binary inspiral systems. However, an unexpected source requires a non-templated
analysis and many burst algorithms are robust for that. I will start the
presentation by explaining burst types and their search methods; special focus
will be given to Gamma-ray burst searches using external triggers. Some burst
algorithms are able to reconstruct the gravitational waveform, a key piece of
information once an unknown source is detected. I will talk about a recent
study of waveform reconstruction using Bayeswave, as well as a new method to
interpret unmodelled GW burst signals."
