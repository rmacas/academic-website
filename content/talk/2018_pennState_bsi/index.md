title: Gravitational-wave Bursts: Searching for the Unknown
event: Classical and Quantum Gravity Seminar Series

location: State College, PA, USA

abstract: "Parameter estimation of all gravitational-wave signals detected so
far relies on precise source models. They are usually limited to alread known
objects making them unsuitable for interpreting new unknown sources. Current
and future gravitational-wave detectors will give unparalleled amounts of data
with prospects of observing unknown objects, therefore an alternative method
for extracting source properties is needed. In this talk I will present a novel
method to reconstruct source properties by decomposing the source mass density
perturbation. Our algorithm is able to reconstruct compact binary coalescences
such as GW150914, as well as several other example cases. I will end the talk
by discussing the method's limitations and possible improvements."
