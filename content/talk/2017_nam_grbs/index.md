title: Gravitational Wave Search Using Gamma-ray Bursts with Advanced LIGO
event: National Astronomy Meeting
event_url: https://nam2017.org/

location: Hull, United Kingdom

abstract: "I will present results from Advanced Laser Interferometer
Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO) search for gravitational waves (GWs)
associated with gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) during LIGO’s first observing run in
2015-16. Gamma-ray bursts are expected to have a GW counterpart that could be
observed by Advanced LIGO; the detection of coincident radiation would give an
unprecedented opportunity for multimessenger astronomy. Gamma-ray satellites
reported 110 GRBs from which 41 had sufficient duration and quality of LIGO
data to be analyzed. While no candidates were found, we put lower bounds on the
median source distance for various scenarios of GW emission. I will also talk
about the search for GWs associated with GRB 150906B, for which the potential
host galaxy NGC 3313 is at a luminosity distance of only 54 Mpc (z = 0.0124). I
will conclude with an update about LIGO’s second observing run that started on
November 30, 2016."
