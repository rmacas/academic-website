title: Search For Gravitational Waves Associated With Gamma-Ray Bursts During The Second Advanced LIGO-Virgo Observing Run
event: National Astronomy Meeting

location: Lancaster, United Kingdom

abstract: "Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are one of the most violent phenomena in the
universe. They are generally divided into two categories: short-duration bursts
created by a collision of two compact sources such as binary neutron stars; and
long-duration bursts that are powered by the core collapse of rapidly rotating
massive stars. We expect GRBs to be intrinsically linked to gravitational-wave
(GW) emission, providing an opportunity for multimessenger astronomy. In this
talk, I will present results from targeted GW searches associated with GRBs
during the second Advanced LIGO-Virgo observing run. We have analyzed 42 (98)
GRBs with modeled (unmodeled) searches and found no candidates other than
GW170817. I will briefly discuss the case of GW170817-GRB170817A, as well as
results for non-detections: analysis of subthreshold GRB population and lower
bounds on the median source distance for various scenarios of GW emission.
Finally, I will discuss the implications of these results for source rates and
future observing runs."
